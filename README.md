Lines from the CLI for README

I just added these lines.

This is another time around that I'm adding some stuff to be commited.

I just added / staged and commited this at once using:
	git commit -a -m "commit msg here..."

Then I undid the commit so that I could modify it (however) and then re-commit it using:
	git reset --soft HEAD^
...and that's when I added thses last few lines to be included.
