So I (Todd) tried to push & couldn't.
I pulled from origin, auto merge failed because we'd bother edited this file as noted above. So I opened the file manually to make corrections / adjustments so that both sets of changes are copacetic.  Then I can complete the merge locally and push the merged files back to origin.
